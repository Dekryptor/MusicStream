# MusicStream
A NodeJS server and web client for streaming music (and videos) to your network

## Install
Try the universal_python_executer.py if you have python installed.
Otherwise move into the folder of your platform and execute one of the files within that folder.
If both of these methods fail, use the manual method.

#### Manual installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
2. Clone or download the Github repo
3. Within the directory run: `npm install && npm start` in a command line
4. Go to: http://localhost:8000

## Notes
The web-interface only works with browsers that have ES6 support.

This program needs Node-ID3 version 0.0.10 or higher to work with images properly.

Supported browsers with build numbers:
- Edge: 14
- Chrome: 49
- Firefox: 52
- Safari: 10
- Opera: 44
- IOS (Safari): 9.3
- Android (Chrome): 57
- Android browser (WebView): 56

Internet Explorer won't work. (*but why would you use it anyway.*)

**You can still use it on old browsers. On the frontpage it will ask you to move to the old browsers page. The features are very limited tho.**

**Only tested (and used) on Chrome Canary 60 and Android Chrome 58**
